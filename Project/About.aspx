Martial arts where developed for entertainment during peace time and to keep warriors fit and ready for war time.Through systematic practice in the martial arts a person's physical fitness may be boosted that is, their strength,stamina,flexibility,movement,co-ordination,etc. as the whole body is exercised and the entire system is activated.Beyond contributing to the physical fitness,martial arts training also has benifits for mental health,contributing to self-esteem,self-control,emotional and spiritual well-being.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">Martal Arts styles create "inner peace" in a practitioner,which is stressed to be only achieved through individual meditation and physical training.Practicing Martial Arts makes believe that the use of physical force is only justified through defense.For this reason,our Artes Marciales has focused on de-emphasizing the historical aspect of self defence or combat completely.</p>
